# John Knox's Galley Slave Ordeal

## Source Excerpt from *History of the Reformation in Scotland*

> "After we were taken, we were carried to the galleys, where we were chained to the oars and compelled to row, our bodies tormented with sores and our spirits with the mockery of our captors. Yet in that misery, the Lord preserved us, and we comforted one another with the remembrance of His promises. I have often thought that the time spent in the galley was a preparation for the greater trials that lay ahead in the work of reformation."

## Annotation

**Historical Context**: John Knox was captured after the fall of St Andrews Castle in 1547 and served as a galley slave on French ships for about 19 months. This period was a crucible that shaped his theological resilience and anti‑Catholic polemic.

**Significance of the Experience**: The physical suffering and constant threat of death deepened Knox's conviction that the Church of Rome was a tyrannical power opposing true Christianity. His description of mutual encouragement among the prisoners reflects the emerging Reformed emphasis on congregational solidarity and lay piety.

**Impact on Later Ministry**: Knox’s galley ordeal became a recurring motif in his sermons and writings, symbolizing the persecution of the godly by worldly powers. It steeled his resolve to confront the Scottish monarchy and the Catholic hierarchy, fueling the uncompromising rhetoric that would characterize the Scottish Reformation.

**Further Research Directions**: Comparative study of other Protestant prisoners on the galleys; material conditions aboard French galleys in the mid‑16th century; how Knox’s narrative fits within the broader genre of martyr literature.
