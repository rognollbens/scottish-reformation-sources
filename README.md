# scottish-reformation-sources

A digital collection of annotated primary sources for the Scottish Reformation.

## Project Purpose

This repository serves as an educational resource to make key historical documents from the Scottish Reformation accessible to students, scholars, and enthusiasts. Our goal is to highlight the human struggle and conviction that fueled the Reformation, with a special focus on John Knox's captivity as a galley slave. Through annotated primary sources, we aim to advocate for the principles of the Reformation and foster a deeper understanding of this pivotal period in Scottish history.
